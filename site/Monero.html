		What is Monero?
		Monero (XMR) is the top <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en?category_id=37&view=market">privacy-centric
			cryptocurrency</a> based on the <a
			href="https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Cryptonight">CryptoNote protocol</a>, a secure, private
		and untraceable currency system. Monero uses a special kind of cryptography to ensure that all of its
		transactions are remain 100% unlinkable and untraceable. In an increasingly transparent world, you can see why
		something like Monero can become so desirable.

		Origins of Monero
		In July of 2012, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bytecoin">Bytecoin</a>, the first real life
		implementation of CryptoNote, was launched. While Bytecoin had promise, people noticed that 80% of the coins
		were already published. So, it was decided that the bytecoin blockchain will be forked and the new coins in the
		new chain will be called Bitmonero, which is was then renamed Monero, meaning “coin” in Esperanto language. In
		this new blockchain, a block will be mined and added every two minutes.

		Why Monero?

		#1: Unlinkability - Your identity is completely private

		You have complete control over your transactions. You are responsible for your money. Because your identity is
		private no one will be able to see what you are spending your money on. When you send funds to someone’s public
		address, what happens is that you actually send the funds to a randomly created brand new one-time destination
		address.

		This means that the public record does not contain any mention that funds were received to the recipient’s
		public address. In Monero, your public address will never appear in the public record of transactions. Instead,
		a 'stealth address' is recorded in a way that only you, the recipient, can recognize the incoming funds.

		#2: Fungibility

		Fungibility is interchangeability between one asset and another asset of the same type.

		Suppose you borrowed $50 from your friend, you can even return the money in the form of 1 $50 bill or 5 $10
		bill, It is still fine. This shows that the dollar has fungible properties. However, if you were to borrow
		someone’s car for the weekend and come back and give them some other car in return, then that person will
		probably punch on the face. Cars, in this example, are a nonfungible asset.

		What is <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Cryptonight">CryptoNote</a>?
		CryptoNote is the application layer protocol that fuels various decentralized currencies. While it is similar to
		the application layer which runs bitcoin in many aspects, there a lot of areas where the two differ from each
		other. CryptoNote features an entirely new code base and is not a fork of <a
			href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>. More info about CryptoNote can be found at
		their <a href="https://cryptonote.org/" rel="nofollow">website</a>.

		CryptoNote uses Ring Signatures to conceal sender identities via mixing and it also has unlinkable transactions
		that is achieved using 1-time keys for each individual payments. Ring signatures enable ‘transaction mixing’ to
		occur. Transaction mixing means that when funds are sent, the sender randomly chooses several other users’ funds
		to also appear in the transaction as a possible source of the funds being sent.

		The cryptographical nature of the ring signature means that no one can tell which of the funds were really the
		source of the transaction – not even the person that gave the funds to the sender in the first place. A system
		of ‘key images’ associated with each ring signature ensures that although no one can tell the true source of the
		funds, it can be easily detected if the sender attempts to anonymously send their funds twice.
